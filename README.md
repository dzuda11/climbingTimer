# climbingTimer
This project is again nothing special, looking form the technical side, but it was real life hackathon and logistical nightmare. It's basically timer for speed climbing with two custom made laser motion detector and remote monitoring time over WiFi devices (phone, tablet, laptop,...). I built software for about 24h and my friend Ognjen built sensors. The only problem was that we didn't have all components so in one day, alongside with coding I have to organize delivery for parts from three different cities with limited (actually without) budget. The timer is based on ESP8266. Developed  mostly using C++ for ESP and HTML, CSS, JavaScript (incl. JSON and AJAX) for user interface.
